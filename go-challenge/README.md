#Suggestion Service Using Go

This repo does not contain all of the files necessary for the program to execute.

For this challenge I have built a suggestion service that returns possible matches based on what a user has typed so far. These kinds of services need to be very high-performance, so I have used the Go programming language to build a compiled executable, and have implemented a trie data structure to make finding matches very efficient.
